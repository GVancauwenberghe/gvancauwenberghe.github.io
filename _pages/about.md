I'm a senior consultant, researcher and research manager in the domains of **geospatial data, data infrastructures and digital transformation**. My main field of expertise is related to the governance and and policy aspects of geospatial data and data infrastructures.

Research & education
------
I obtained an MSc degree in Sociology and a MSc degree in the Management of Public Organizations. In 2013 I obtained a **PhD-degree on the topic of ‘Coordination in the context of Spatial Data Infrastructures’**. In my PhD research I explored how different coordination instruments and mechanisms can be used to coordinate the exchange of, the access to and to use of spatial data. In 2016, I was awarded a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Research Fellowship for my research project on **the governance of open geospatial data and data infrastructures**. I have strong experience in the use of both quantitative and qualitative research methods and tools, including survey research, in-depth interviewing, case study research and statistical data analysis. 

Experience
------
Since 2007, I have been involved in many **national and international projects in the domains of space, earth observation and geospatial data**, in which I mainly focused on data policies, the governance of (spatial) data infrastructures, the assessment of data policies and infrastructures, business & funding models and the integration of geospatial data in digital government.  I provided **support to the development and implementation of (geospatial) data infrastructures** in many countries in the world, such as Belgium, Mozambique, Peru, Algeria, Morocco, Moldova, Romania, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy. In many of these countries, I contributed to the design and implementation of new business and fundings models and effective data sharing arrangements. 


Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
