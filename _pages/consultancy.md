**Role in the project:** Policy Research Expert

**Description:** The European Commission is exploring options for establishing common rules, standards and guidelines for a comprehensive space traffic management system allowing safe access to and use of space by national, European, and international space operators. The objectives of this project on STM Standardisation were to 1) analyse how space manufacturers and operators in the EU comply with non-binding rules and standards for space traffic management, 2) analyse the feasibility of establishing an EU-wide mechanism to support soft law compliance in space traffic management and 3) carry out outreach activities related to the EU-wide mechanism to support standardisation in space traffic management.

**Activities performed:** 
* Definition of project scope, methodology, stakeholder engagement strategy, risk assessment and detailed work plan in the project proposal and inception report

* Consultations with key stakeholders in the domains of space and STM in Europe and worldwide

## Pilot Project on Space Traffic Management - The rise of importance of Space Traffic Management
**Year:** 2020-2022

**Client/funding:** European Commission – DG DEFIS

**Role in the project:** Policy Research Expert

**Description:** The overarching goal of the project was the execution of a pilot study to support the development of a comprehensive approach on Space Traffic Management (STM) in Europe, covering all phases of the spacecraft, from design, launch and operations to end-of-life, with an overall aim of ensuring long-term, open, sustainable and safe use of space, while fostering European space ecosystems and ensuring Europe’s strategic autonomy. The study also contributed to raising public awareness among policy makers and interdisciplinary research on the legal and regulatory framework. The project proposed a definition of STM in a EU context, and analyse the impact of ongoing developments in space activities and identify related challenges. The effectiveness and relevance of existing legal and regulatory frameworks and practices were assessed. Practical recommendations and next steps at the national, European and international levels were formulated, taking into account the legal bases for action at the European level.

**Activities performed:** 
* Definition of project scope, methodology, stakeholder engagement strategy, risk assessment and detailed work plan in the project proposal and inception report
* Analysis of existing legal and regulatory frameworks and practices in the STM domain
* Assessment of possible policy actions for implementing a EU-approach to STM
* Consultations with key stakeholders in the domains of space and STM in Europe and worldwide

## The costs and benefits of geospatial web services of the national Spanish SDI-node
**Year:** 2020 - 2021

**Client/funding:** National Center for Geographic Information, Spain

**Role in the project:** Senior Researcher

**Description:** The National Geographical Information Centre (CNIG) of Spain wanted to tackle the challenge of assessing the benefits and costs of SDIs through a dedicated project on estimation the costs and benefits of the Central SDI-node of Spain, i.e. the National Geographic Institute (NGI). In this project, a new and innovative approach for cost-benefit evaluation and value estimation was developed and tested. The approach was based on three steps: 1) a cost estimation is carried out for the Spanish central SDI-node based on figures collected for the cost of implementation, management and maintenance of the metadata and geospatial web services; 2) an approximate evaluation of the benefits obtained is then computed taken as a reference the pricing schema defined by Google for the use of its web mapping API's; and 3) a comparative analysis of a few selected European SDI's that charge for geospatial web services by using the price of the services as point of reference.

**Activities performed:** 
* Analysis of geospatial data licensing and pricing models in different EU countries
* Data collection through interviews and desk research
* Engagement of SDI-stakeholders in different EU countries
* Estimation of the benefits of the Spanish SDI-node and its services provided

## Copernicus Service Component R&D needs collection and analysis for Horizon Europe and stakeholder consultation
**Year:** 2019

**Client/funding:** European Commission – DG GROW

**Role in the project:** Senior Expert

**Description:** The overall aim of this project was the provision of support to the European Commission in collecting and analysing the Copernicus Research and Development (R&D) needs for the next Horizon Europe in the context of the Service component evolution and downstream activities. This support addressed two areas: 1. Analysis of past Copernicus workshops and a number of Horizon 2020 initiatives; and 2. Organisation of two concluding consultation workshops with stakeholders. The analysis of relevant Copernicus workshops and H2020 initiatives resulted in a collection and classification of R&D needs for Copernicus within the services evolution and the downstream context. During two stakeholders workshops the identified needs were further discussed and validated with stakeholders in different sectors and domains.

**Activities performed:** 
* Definition of project scope, methodology, stakeholder engagement strategy, risk assessment and detailed work plan in the project proposal and inception report
* Engagement of stakeholders in the R&D domain of the EU space sector
* Desk research on Copernicus Research & Development needs
