## Feasibility studies on the added value of remote sensing technologies in EU development cooperation projects
**Year:** 2019-2020

**Client/funding:** European Commission - DG DEVCO

**Role in the project:** Senior Expert

**Description:** The general purpose of the project was to demonstrate the added-value of remote sensing in three specific international development cooperation projects in order to develop a long-term, robust and sustainable framework for using Copernicus observation data in development cooperation. In particular, the study team supported DG DEVCO with the preparation of three feasibility studies covering a thorough situation analysis (including assessment of the relevant legal frameworks), a technical/operational analysis and economic analysis for three candidate pilot projects. The three projects were identified as (a) an emergency service data centre in Panama, (b) reuse of water management remote sensing globally, and (c) reuse of land use remote sensing globally.

## Towards an Open Spatial Data Infrastructure in Peru
**Year:** 2019-2020

**Client/funding:** KU Leuven - Multi-stakeholder Grant

**Role in the project:** Senior Researcher

**Description:** The aim of this project was to evaluate the openness of the Peruvian Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), which consists of a set of policies, standards, organizations, human and technological resources to facilitate the access to and sharing of spatial data in Peru. In an open SDI, also citizens can participate in and benefit from the development of the infrastructure. With this new approach to the study and assessment of SDIs we aimed to contribute to the realization of a more open SDI in Peru as a key enabler for improved public services, transparency, accountability, and citizen participation. In this project, an assessment framework was developed to assess the openness of SDIs, with particular attention to the participation of citizens and the delivery of spatially enabled e-services to citizens as key dimension of Open SDI. This framework was applied to the SDI in order to gain insight in the openness of the Peruvian SDI and contribute to the development of an action plan towards a more Open SDI in Peru. The project was executed in collaboration with local researchers and NGOs.
