##  Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE)
The INSPIRE Directive aims to create a **European Union Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI)** for the purposes of EU environmental policies and policies or activities which may have an impact on the environment. This European Spatial Data Infrastructure enables the sharing of environmental spatial information among public sector organisations, facilitates public access to spatial information across Europe and assists in policy-making across boundaries. INSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for spatial information established and operated by the Member States of the European Union. The Directive addresses 34 spatial data themes needed for environmental applications. 

The INSPIRE Directive lays down general rules for the establishment of an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe, in support of the Community environmental policies and policies or activities which may have an impact on the environment.The Directive was published in the official Journal on the 25th April 2007 and entered into force on the 15th May 2007. [Read more about this Directive](https://knowledge-base.inspire.ec.europa.eu/legislation_en). 

Contribution to this initiative:
* Supporting the implementation of this Directive in several countries, including Belgium, Italy, Romania, Moldova and various other. 
* Designing and delivering training on the implementation of this Directive, with a strong focus on the non-technological aspects 
* Assessing the status of implementing the Directive and collecting best practices in different countries
* Providing input to the mid-term evaluation of the Directive, through the SmeSpire study on the Geo-ICT Sector in Europe

## EU Approach for Space Traffic Management
In light of an increasingly congested space, there is a compelling need to act in order to maintain space as a resource for future generations. Space Traffic Management aims at keeping space operations safe, space orbits usable, and space accessible for decades to come while ensuring and further fostering the competitiveness of the EU industry.

To this end, the **EU approach to Space Traffic Management** proposed by the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR/VP) aims at enhancing capabilities, norms and engagement while preserving EU interests in line with the respective competencies of the Union and its Member States. It calls for an EU contribution to this global challenge along four key lines of action: 1) Assessing STM requirements and impacts for the EU; 2) 
Enhancing operational EU SST capabilities to support STM; 3) Fostering STM regulatory aspects and 4) Promoting the EU STM approach at a global level. [Read more about the EU Approach for STM](https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-space/space-traffic-management_en).

Contribution to this initiative:
* Execution of a pilot study to support the development of a comprehensive approach on Space Traffic Management (STM) in Europe, with an overall aim of ensuring long-term, open, sustainable and safe use of space
* Analyszing the feasibility of establishing a Space Label as EU-wide mechanism to support soft law compliance in space traffic management
* Supporting the impact assessment for a EU Space Law 


## European Location Interoperability Solutions for e-Government (ELISE) 
Location information underpins policy assessment, digital services and applications for public administrations, businesses and citizens. However, interoperability barriers hinder the optimal performance of underlying ICT systems and obstruct economic value creation from location information. To address this need, **the European Location Interoperability Solutions for e-Government (ELISE) Action** was a package of legal/policy, organisational, semantic and technical interoperability solutions that aimed to facilitate more efficient and effective digital cross-border or cross-sector interaction and data re-use in the domain of location information and services.

ELISE aimed  to break down barriers and promote a coherent and consistent approach to the sharing and reusing of location data across sectors and borders in the context of the digital transformation of public services. ELISE built on top of the EULF and ARE3NA actions funded under the former ISA programme. [Read more about ELISE](https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/actions/elise_en/).
