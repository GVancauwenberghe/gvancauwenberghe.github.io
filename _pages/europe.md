##  Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE)
The INSPIRE Directive aims to create a European Union Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) for the purposes of EU environmental policies and policies or activities which may have an impact on the environment. This European Spatial Data Infrastructure enables the sharing of environmental spatial information among public sector organisations, facilitates public access to spatial information across Europe and assists in policy-making across boundaries. INSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for spatial information established and operated by the Member States of the European Union. The Directive addresses 34 spatial data themes needed for environmental applications. 

The INSPIRE Directive lays down general rules for the establishment of an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe, in support of the Community environmental policies and policies or activities which may have an impact on the environment.The Directive was published in the official Journal on the 25th April 2007 and entered into force on the 15th May 2007.
