## Geospatial data & technology
Geospatial data and technologies have been at the core of my work, since the early stages of my career. My experience spans from examining the value of geospatial data over identifying and describing key topics related to GIS&T to supporting the collection, management, use and sharing of geospatial data. Projects in this area include:
* ELISE 2020 - Leveraging the power of location information and technologies to improve public services at local level (2020-2021)
* Elaboration of standards, norms and procedures in the acquisition and dissemination of geospatial information in Mozambique (2019-2020)
* GI-N2K – Geographic Information Need to Know (2013-2016)

## Data sharing & data infrastructures
Data sharing is a key area of focus in my work, with a particular emphasis on setting up effective data infrastructures and supporting sustainable data ecosystems. I have been working on promoting data transparency and data sharing, developing licensing models and business models and optimizing legal & institutional frameworks for effective data sharing. Illustrative projects in this area include:
* USAGE – Urban Data Space for Green Deal (2022-2025)
* ODECO – Towards a sustainable Open Data ECOsystem (2021-2025)
* Towards an Open Spatial Data Infrastructure in Peru (2019-2020)

## Governance & institutional frameworks
Building on my background in public administration research, I have gained expertise in governance and institutional frameworks. This allows me to investigate and evaluate governance & institutional frameworks in place, and to support governments and organisations in shaping effective governance structures. Project examples in this area are:
* International Lessons Learned and Recommendations on Business and Funding Models for Mekong Delta Center (2021-2022)
* Effective Governance of Open Spatial Data (2016-2018)
* SPATIALIST - SDI for Public Sector Innovation (2007-2011)

## Digital transformation
Initially focused on the role of geospatial data and data infrastructures in digital transformation, I have broadened my expertise to encompass all aspects of digital transformation. This includes driving innovation through emerging technologies, fostering organizational change, and implementing data-driven strategies. This area of expertise is demonstrated in projects such as:
* DIS4SME - Data Interoperability Skills for SMEs (2023-2024)
* ELISE Knowledge Transfer: Location Interoperability for Digital Transformation (2019-2020)
* The role of the Spatial Data Infrastructure in the Digital Transformation of Public Administration (2018-2019)

## Policy & decision making
I have been supporting government organizations worldwide across various stages of the policy process, including design, formulation, implementation, and evaluation. This includes providing support in drafting policy and strategic documents, identifying and evaluating policy options, and engaging stakeholders in the policy process through co-creation. Examples of projects in this area are:
* Consultancy for the Development of NSDI Policy Documents in Georgia (2024-2025)
* Support to Space Traffic Management Standardisation (2022-2024)
* INSPIRE Strategy Romania (2014-2015)

## Skills & capacity building

Examples from my work in this area include:
* SEED4NA - Spatial Data Infrastructures and Earth Observation Education and Training for North-Africa (2020-2024)
* giCASES - Creating a University-Enterprise Alliance for a Spatially Enabled Society (2015-2016)
* EO4GEO - Towards an innovative strategy for skills development and capacity building in the space and geo-information sector to support Copernicus user uptake (2018-2022)

## Monitoring & evaluation

This expertise is reflected in projects such as:
* Impact Assessment for the new EU Space Law (2023-2024)
* The costs and benefits of geospatial web services of the national Spanish SDI-node (2020-2021)
* Feasibility studies on the added value of remote sensing technologies in EU development cooperation projects (2019-2020)

## Responsible research & innovation

Relevant project examples include:
* Copernicus Service Component R&D needs collection and analysis for Horizon Europe and stakeholder consultation (2019)
* CENTRIC – Centre of Excellence in Territorial management and Cadastre (European Commission – Horizon 2020 Teaming) - Senior GI Expert
* SmeSpire - A European Community of SMEs built on Environmental Digital Content and Languages (2012-2014)

Most of the projects mentioned cut across multiple areas of expertise. Detailed descriptions of these projects can be accessed via [Projects](https://gvancauwenberghe.github.io/projects).
