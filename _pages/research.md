## RESIST - Regions for climate change resilience through Innovation
**Year:** 2023-2024

**Client/funding:** European Commission – Horizon Europe

**Role in the project:** Scientific Expert

**Description:** RESIST aims to strengthen the resilience, accelerate the transformation and increase the adaptive capacity of 12 climate vulnerable EU regions. This is done by implementing 4 large-scale demonstrators of resilient innovations for Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) following a quintuple-helix approach. The demonstrators will run in four regions but also promote the transfer of know-how and innovative solutions to eight twin regions (of which 4 less developed regions) through both physical mutual-learning activities and the implementation of innovative immersive digital twins.

**Activities performed:** 
* Design of strategy for disseminating the scientific outputs of the project
* Classification and demonstration of climate adaptation solutions  

## USAGE – Urban Data Space for Green Deal
**Year:** 2022 - 2025

**Client/funding:** European Commission – Horizon Europe

**Role in the project:** Senior Researcher

**Description:** USAGE (Urban Data Space for the Green Deal) aims to provide solutions and mechanisms for making city-level environmental and climate data available to everyone based on FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable). USAGE supports the implementation of the European strategy for data and various European Green Deal priority actions at the level where climate change is mostly felt: cities and towns. The project provides innovative governance mechanisms, consolidated arrangements, AI-based tools and data analytics to share, access and use city-level data from Earth Observation (EO), Internet of Things (IoT), authoritative and crowd sources, leveraging on standards for data and service interoperability.

**Activities performed:** 
* Analysis of climate data strategies, processes and policies at city level
* Preparation of guidelines for policy co-design in climate policies
* In-depth interviews with local experts and stakeholders

## ELISE 2020 - Leveraging the power of location information and technologies to improve public services at local level: an EU-wide analysis
**Year:** 2020 - 2021

**Client/funding:** European Commission – Joint Research Center

**Role in the project:** Public Administration Expert

**Description:** The main aim of the project was to investigate the innovative use of location data and technology at local and regional levels in the EU for increasing the quality of public services and producing public value. To achieve this aim, the following project objectives were defined and achieved: to systematically review the state of the art on the innovative use of location data and technologies for delivering public services in the EU; to develop a conceptual framework for assessing the current and potential impact of the use of location data and technologies on public value creation through public services at local level; to extensively study cases to refine, tailor and validate the conceptual framework for different real-life contexts; and to outline future research and policy recommendations.

**Activities performed:** 
* Review of the state of the art on the use of location data and technologies at the local level
* Contributing to design of conceptual framework for investigating the innovative use of location data and technologies
* Case studies on innovative approaches for using location data and technologies in cities and regions
* Drafting of policy recommendations on improving public services at local level through location data and technologies

## The role of the Spatial Data Infrastructure in the Digital Transformation of Public Administration
**Year:** 2018 - 2019

**Client/funding:** European Commission – DG DIGT & Joint Research Center

**Role in the project:** Senior Expert

**Description:** Aim of this study was to first provide a comprehensive analysis and summary of SDI developments in different countries, following the legal and technical implementation frames of the INSPIRE Directive and to afterwards place these innovative developments in the larger context of eGovernment and Digital Transformation. The study helped understanding the relation between progresses in eGovernment and implementation of INSPIRE and demonstrating the role of INSPIRE as building block for digital government

**Activities performed:** 
* Design of study on investigating the role of SDI in Digital Transformation
* Analysis of SDI developments and their role in Digital Transformation in 29 European countries
* Identification and in-depth analysis of best practices in SDI & DT
* Application of OECD recommendations on Digital Government Strategies to SDI/INSPIRE developments in Europe

## Effective Governance of Open Spatial Data
**Year:** 2016-2018

**Client/funding:** European Commission, MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships

**Role in the project:** Research Manager & Researcher

**Description:** The central research question the project aimed to answer was: what is the impact of different models for governing open spatial data on the performance of open spatial data policies in Europe? To answer this research question, a case study approach was implemented, analysing two countries that were among the leading open data countries in the world: the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. In addition, an assessment was made of the openness of Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe, with a particular focus on applied governance mechanisms. The project was executed in close collaboration with the Dutch Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations, and the Open Data Institute in the United Kingdom, one of the pioneering bodies in Europe in the field of open data.

**Activities performed:** 
* Definition of project scope, methodology, stakeholder engagement strategy, risk assessment and detailed work plan
* Development and application of a framework for assessing the openness of SDIs
* Case studies on (open) geospatial data and applied governance mechanisms
* Author of book chapters on ‘Business Models for Geographic Information’ and 'Governance of Open Spatial Data'

## CENTRIC – Centre of Excellence in Territorial management and Cadastre
**Year:** 2015 - 2016 

**Client/funding:** European Commission – Horizon 2020 Teaming

**Role in the project:** Senior GI Expert

**Description:** The Romanian Government decided to ensure financial support to a National Programme for a Unitary System of Cadastre and Land Registration, with a focus on the delivery of a unique database of all information on existing real estate properties. CENTRIC wanted to introduce State-of-the-Art Geographic Information Science & Technology and to implement innovative solutions. Through know-how transfer from leading RTD institutions in Europe involved in the project, CENTRIC ensured scientific excellence and a strong positioning of Romania within the aforementioned domain. CENTRIC aimed at the creation of a new Centre of Excellence on territorial management and cadastre. In particular, a detailed business plan will be developed. 

**Activities performed:** 
* Elaboration of business model and future research agenda of the Centre
* Design of curricula and mobility scheme for capacity building within the Centre

##  SmeSpire - A European Community of SMEs built on Environmental Digital Content and Languages
**Year:** 2012 - 2014

**Client/funding:** European Commission – FP7 Support Action

**Role in the project:** Researcher

**Description:** The purpose of the project was to encourage and enable the participation of SMEs in the implementation of Spatial Data Infrastructures, and INSPIRE in particular. Therefore smeSpire assessed the market potential for SMEs, collated and exploited a Best Practice Catalogue in the management of environmental content, developed a training curriculum and package to help filling the knowledge gap, and created a network capable of transferring result-driven knowledge throughout Europe with research centres, environmental agencies, technology and digital content providers. 

**Activities performed:** 
* Design and implementation of a study on the European Geo-ICT sector, and the impact of NSDI/INSPIRE on this sector
* Design of training programme on NSDI/INSPIRE for SMEs
