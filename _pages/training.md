## ELISE Knowledge Transfer II : Digital Transformation and the future of SDI
**Year:** 2019 - 2021 

**Client/funding:** European Commission – DG DIGIT & Joint Research Centre

**Role in the project:** Senior Expert

**Description:** The project ‘ELISE Knowledge Transfer: Digital Transformation and the Future of SDI’ aimed to consolidate and continue the work already done by the ELISE Action of the European ISA² Programme, on ‘European Location Interoperability Solutions for e-Government, in order to provide to public administrations the right tools to apprehend the role of geospatial in Digital Government Transformation and how this role will evolve in the future. New and updated knowledge on various relevant topics was developed through several rapid studies and two larger studies on the use of environmental data and cross-border data flows.

**Activities performed:** 
* Data collection on the use of spatial data for environmental purposes through a survey among practitioners in Europe
* Longitudinal study on the evolution in accessing and using spatial data for environmental purposes
* Input to the study on the cross-border use of geospatial data

## ELISE Knowledge Transfer: Location Interoperability for Digital Transformation
**Year:** 2019 - 2020 

**Client/funding:** European Commission – DG DIGIT & Joint Research Centre

**Role in the project:** Senior Expert

**Description:** The aim of this project was to create a set of materials that support knowledge transfer and capacity building in the context of location interoperability and digital transformation. The project helped to better define the landscape between these two topics, particularly within the view of public administrations. A top-down approach based on existing evidence and a means to guide thinking was combined with a bottom-up approach that aimed to foster collaboration, build capacity and validate/update the resources involved. Among the resources developed and provided during the project were vocabularies related to digital skills in the context of location interoperability and digital transformation, a Geospatial Primer for Digital Transformation, a set of rapid studies on various topics within the scope of the project, a Location Interoperability workshop package, and an update of the EULF Blueprint and the related guidance document on Architectures and Standards for SDIs in Digital Government. 

**Activities performed:** 
* Contribution to the development of a vocabulary of geo-ICT skills
* Rapid studies on key topics related to location interoperability & digital transformation
* Review and revision of the European Union Location Framework (EULF) Blueprint
