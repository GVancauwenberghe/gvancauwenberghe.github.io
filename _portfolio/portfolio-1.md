In the book chapter 'Social Network Analysis of the SDI in Flanders', social network analysis was used to study the network of spatial data exchanges between spatial data users and producers in Flanders. The method was applied to measure the density and the centralization of the network and the centrality of the actors in this network. 

Data needed for this network analysis were collected through an online questionnaire sent to 508 public organizations in Flanders (Belgium). All regional, provincial, and municipal authorities in Flanders were invited to participate in this survey. In addition, a selection of federal organizations, intermunicipal organizations, and harbors was also invited. Private organizations and nonprofit organizations were left out because the focus was on the exchange of spatial data within the public sector.

The main objective of the study was the identification of spatial data flows among public organizations. In order to identify these data flows in a clear and unambiguous manner, four specific types of spatial data were selected: parcel data, address data, road data, and hydrographic data. For each spatial data type, organizations were asked to indicate whether they used, produced, and/or received these data. In case they received a certain type of data from one or more other organizations, they were requested to identify the suppliers.

Based on the collected data, the network of spatial data exchanges in Flanders (Belgium) was analyzed in a graphical and a mathematical manner. A graphical representation of the SDI network is presented in the figure above. In this figure, all organizations are represented as nodes, while their relational ties are represented by lines. The actors in this network are positioned by their administrative levels. Four levels can be distinguished: (1) the Belgian federal organizations (at the top), (2) the organizations of the Flemish public administration, (3) the five provinces, and (4) the municipalities (at the bottom row).

Between these organizations, 410 lines can be discerned. These lines refer to the exchange of at least one type of spatial data. Even organizations that exchange more than one type of data are linked with only one line in the figure. However, if we consider each type of data as a distinct relational tie and allow organizations to be connected by multiple ties, the total number of ties becomes 713. The most central actors in the network are marked and identified. 

This study demonstrated that social network analysis can provide insight into the impact of each of these arrangements on the access to and the exchange of spatial data in Flanders. Of the analyzed data, 80% are facilitated by one of these arrangements. In addition, the study illustrated how social network analysis could be used to analyze the interactions between these different arrangements. For instance, the graphical network analysis of the SDI shows that, to a certain extent, these arrangements are complementary to each other—in the sense that they redistribute each other’s data to specific groups of users. The analysis demonstrates that the Flemish SDI is partly hierarchically organized because data from higher administrative levels are distributed by lower administrative levels. It is worth noting that social network analysis can be used to reveal the hierarchical characteristics of an SDI in an empirical, quantitative manner.

Nevertheless, the SDI in Flanders could be considered as completely hierarchical. For instance, the provincial redistribution of spatial data is
restricted to a limited number of provinces. In some cases the provincial SDI level is missing. To a large extent, the distribution of spatial data is centrally organized because the AGIV provides spatial data to all the administrative levels. Social network analysis is useful in demonstrating the overlap between the different SDI arrangements. The method allows us to illustrate that identical or similar types of spatial data are provided by multiple arrangements to the same users. Finally, social network analysis also takes into account the more informal exchanges of spatial data. In our analysis, one fifth of all data flows could not be linked directly to one of the formal arrangements we considered.
