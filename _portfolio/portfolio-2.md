_This is a summary of the report 'Cipriano, P., Easton, C., Roglia, E., Vancauwenberghe, G. (2013). Study on the Geo-ICT sector in Europe. SmeSpire'. The full report can be found [here](http://www.smespire.eu/published-by-smespire-the-first-study-on-the-geo-ict-sector-in-europe)._

The report '**Study on the Geo-ICT Sector in Europe**' provided an in-depth analysis and comparison of different Geo-ICT companies in Europe and how they relate to INSPIRE. The studyâ€™s primary objectives were: 1) assessing the market potential for Geo-ICT companies in relation to INSPIRE, and 2) characterizing obstacles for Geo-ICT companies to enter this market, with focus on knowledge gaps and training needs

The study was carried out in **four stages**:
* Desk research using published statistics to describe the Geo-ICT SME sector and its context
* On-line survey to establish an overview of targeted Geo-ICT SMEs in 12 Member States
* In-depth interviews to establish the detailed circumstances of the targeted Geo-ICT SMEs
* Workshops where results were discussed and validated in a collaborative approach.
