_This is a summary of the article 'Vancauwenberghe, G., Valečkaitė, K., van Loenen, B. & Welle Donker, F. (2018). Assessing the Openness of Spatial Data Infrastructures: Towards a Map of Open SDI. International Journal of Spatial Data Infrastructures Research, 13. The full article can be found [here](https://ijsdir.sadl.kuleuven.be/index.php/ijsdir/article/view/468)._

This paper introduced the **Open Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) Assessment Framework** as a new approach for assessing the openness of SDIs. Open SDIs are SDIs in which non-government actors such as businesses, citizens, researchers and non-profit organizations can contribute to the development and implementation of the SDI, use spatial data with as few restrictions as possible and benefit from using these geographic data. A pilot application of the new framework resulted in the Map of Open SDI in Europe, which aimed to show the level of openness of national SDIs in Europe. The map could become a relevant and practical tool that shows the status of Open SDIs in Europe and supports decision makers and practitioners in making their own SDI more open.

THe figure above shows the first **prototype of the Map of Open SDI in Europe** based on  preliminary data as collected by students, which were afterwards validated by the authors of this paper. This resulted in a full overview of the 28 EU Member States as well as Norway. It should be noted that the prototype was only used to introduce the rationale and approach behind the Open SDI Assessment Framework, since the process of validating the data was still ongoing and the preliminary data contained some missing and incorrect values. The figure shows how the Open SDI Assessment Framework allows for the comparison of countries with respect to the openness of their SDI.

The figure shows three separate maps representing the **Readiness, the Data and the Impact dimensions**. The maps not only show the differences between countries, but also how the situation within one country can be different for these three dimensions. While in some countries, the national SDI can be considered to be open with respect to all three dimensions (e.g. Finland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom), other countries are doing especially well with respect to one single dimension (e.g. Estonia with its high score on the Data dimension).
