_This is a summary of the report 'European Commission: Joint Research Centre, Barbero, M., Lopez Potes M., Vancauwenberghe G., & Vandenbroucke D. (2019). The role of Spatial Data Infrastructures in the Digital Government Transformation of Public Administrations. Luxembourg: Publications Office of the European Union'.

Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) play a pivotal role in Digital Government Transformation (DGT) of countries. They constitute one of the main building blocks for effective data sharing and their development in the past years has taught some important lessons to public authorities in terms of collaboration across sectors, centricity of usersâ€™ needs as well as usefulness of platforms and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). However, the specific analysis of the role that SDIs play in Digital Government Transformation had not been the object of many studies. With practitioners and academics acknowledging more and more the links between these two concepts, there was a need to provide **an initial picture of how SDIs have contributed to Digital Government Transformation** until now and what could be their role in the future. 

This study was a first attempt to examine this relation and develop **a methodology for apprehending the role of SDIs in the Digital Transformation of the public sector**. It first developed an analytical framework for examining different aspects that can provide an explanation of the relationship between SDIs and DGT and notably institutional aspects, technical aspects and impact aspects. It then tested this framework on twenty-nine countries (all European Member States plus Norway) in order to assess the validity of this instrument for the collection of data as well as for the wider understanding of this topic. From these analytical and data collection efforts, it emerged the strength of the relationship that SDIs and Digital Government Transformation entertained and the variety of ways in which countries understood and cultivated it. The study also provided an attempt to link the OECD Recommendation on Digital Governments with the SDIs and Digital Transformation experience of the countries in scope. This also helped understanding that SDIs already significantly support Digital Government Transformation, even from the OECD perspective, and that this relationship would only be stronger in the future.
