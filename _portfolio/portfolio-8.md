The main objective of the SPIDER project was to promote and strengthen active learning and teaching towards Open SDI. More specific objectives of the project were 1)
to explore, develop and implement the concept of Open SDI as a new paradigm to SDI education; 2) to promote and facilitate active and multidisciplinary learning and teaching on Open SDI; and 3) to drive the exchange and update of Open SDI teaching and learning resources by teachers and students.

One of the key project outputs contributing to achieving these objectives was the Mapping of SDI Education in Europe. This mapping of SDI Education in Europe explored and investigated the existing offer of academic education on SDI in Europe , and identified the actors currently involved and topics covered in SDI education. The mapping of SDI Education provides an in depth description and investigation of existing courses on SDI , collecting and analysing information on the programs in which SDI education is included, the topics addressed, the learning objectives and the teaching and learning activities that are adopted.

The information on these courses was made available through the online Map of SDI Education. The first version of this map included 126 different courses, from 63
different higher education institutions in Europe, in 22 different countries.
