## Description
Digital transformation refers to the profound changes taking place in the economy and society as a result of the uptake and integration of digital technologies in every aspect of human life. Governments are also using digital technologies to transform their interactions with stakeholders and with each other. Digital Government Transformation is about creating open, efficient and inclusive public administrations that provide high-quality services to citizens, businesses and other stakeholders.

Governments have been using geospatial data as part of their policy-making processes for over 30 years, while these data also provides the backbone to a range of online service delivery efforts at all levels of government. In the last 20 years, significant efforts have been made to standardise and harmonise online data sharing related to geospatial data, through the establishment of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs). The INSPIRE Directive that is developing a European SDI based on Member States’ infrastructures can be seen as the largest data interoperability effort ever undertaken in Europe. Geospatial data, services, technologies and thinking have many features that could be ‘transformative’ that we want to explore in an equally open way with a range of stakeholders.

The aim of this webinar was to set the scene and explore the broad role of geospatial data and SDIs as important enablers and building blocks of digital government transformation. The webinar placed past and ongoing developments in the use and sharing of geospatial data in the wider context of digital transformation, as well as addressed some of the terms we will be exploring.

The webinar was the first of a series of “Rapid Studies” under the ELISE ISA2 Action that aim to quickly engage with new topics of relevance to location interoperability, the digital transformation of government and socio-technical developments in this arena.
