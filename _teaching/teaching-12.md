The aim of this webinar was to explore the importance of "geospatial" and "interoperability" in the creation and management of digital twins. In this webinar, the current state of play on the development and deployment of digital twins in Europe and how they rely on geospatial data, data infrastructures and technologies were presented.

## Content
* Definitions of the fast-emerging ‘digital twins’ concept, and how they are related to key concepts and developments in the geospatial domain
* Policies and policy initiatives related to or relevant to the creation of digital twins, and geospatial digital twins in particular
* Geospatial data, standards and technologies that are essential for creating and managing these digital twins
* Practices and initiatives to develop geospatial digital twins at different levels, including buildings, cities, countries and the entire earth
* Key challenges in creating and managing geospatial digital twins 

## Description
Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical objects or systems that are used to better understand, predict, and optimize the performance of their counterpart in the physical world. They are built by integrating many different technologies, and are accelerating the digital transformation of government and industry.

The aim of this webinar was to explore the importance of "geospatial" and "interoperability" in the creation and management of digital twins. In this webinar, we presenrted the current state of play on the development and deployment of digital twins in Europe and how they rely on geospatial data, data infrastructures and technologies.

This webinar was the ninth event of the ELISE webinar series performed by the JRC under the ELISE ISA2 Action. The aim of these webinars was to quickly engage with new topics of relevance to the Digital transformation of Government by leveraging the use of geospatial data, technology and skills in line with interoperability frameworks and practices.
