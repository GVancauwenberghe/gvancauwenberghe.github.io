## Description
From 15 to 19 April 2024, SADL was co-organizer of the fourth ODECO training week, which took place at the Faculty of Social Sciences of KU Leuven. The main topic of the training week, which consisted of five days of training, was inclusiveness of open data ecosystems. Training on this topic – but also on various other topics and aspects – was provided by staff members from the ODECO partners but also several external experts, from key stakeholders in the EU (open) data domain, such as the EU Publications Office, DG DIGIT, SWECO Netherlands, the National Geographical Institute of Belgium and BOSA, the Federal Public Service Policy and Support.

On Wednesday the 17th of April, Glenn Vancauwenberghe gave a presentation about the impact of the ODECO project, and how to increase this impact through effective communication, dissemination and exploitation. In this presentation, the participating PhD students were invited to reflect about the current and expected impact of their research and of the overall ODECO project. Students also learned about measures to maximize the outcomes and impact of their work, through dissemination, exploitation and communication.
