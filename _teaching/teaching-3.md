During the 2022 SEED4NA Summer School, which took place in Dubvronik (Croatia), teachers from the SEED4NA partner universities were training in how to design and offer education about the establishment of Spatial Data Infrastructures.  

## Approach
In the training session, the participants jointly developed a SEED4NA education/training course on Spatial Data Infrastructures in an (inter)active way. The participants jointly defined:
* The scope and content of the course
* The structure of the course
* Learning objectives
* Teaching and learning activities

## Learning activity 1 - Scope and content of the SDI Course
**Exercise:** The responsible Minister of your country wants to establish an SDI that can be considered as the leading SDI in North Africa. Unfortunately, there’s a lack of skills and knowledge among the current and future workforce:
* What should he/she do?
* What are the components he/she has to put in place?
* What are the skills needed by professionals supporting this ambition?
* What are the topics to be covered in SDI education and training?

_List at least 5 components (or topics to be covered in our SDI course). Try to include 1 ‘unique’ topic._

## Learning activity 2 - Structure and content of the SDI Course
**Exercise:** The dean of your faculty assigns you to develop and implement a 1-semester course on ‘Spatial Data Infrastructures’. The core topics to be covered in this course have been defined by a group of international experts Your first task is to design the structure of the course, together with your colleague(s).

_Propose a structure for your SDI course_

## Learning activity 3 - Learning objectives & learning activities of the SDI Course
**Exercise:** Congratulations! Your course proposal (including the structure of the course) has been accepted! They now want you to further detail the course, by developing:
1. Learning objectives for each of the learning units (following Bloom’s taxonomy)
2. Learning activities through which students are trained to realize these objectives
3. Assessment methods to check if students are meeting these objectives
This work should be done by smaller teams of experts, working on particular topics (or units)

_Develop learning objectives for your topic(s). Propose a set of –innovative –teaching activities for your topic(s). Also think about how you will assess your students._
