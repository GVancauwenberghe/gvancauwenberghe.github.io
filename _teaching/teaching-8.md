## Description
Member States started the implementation of the INSPIRE Directive in 2007. Since then more than 250.000 spatial data and network services have been made available through the European, national and thematic geoportals. However, the integration of INSPIRE network services in day-to-day business processes remains a challenge. There are many good practices of the use of geographic information in the context of e-Governmental processes in which many Government to Citizens (G2C), Government to Business (G2B) and Government to Government (G2G) interactions take place. Moreover, the INSPIRE approach can certainly be applied in other policy domains and its added value will become most obvious in cross-border and cross-sector applications.
